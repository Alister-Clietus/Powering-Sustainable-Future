                        Sustainable development is a common agenda for global concern, which everybody agrees upon, but bringing this global concern into public policies is a difficult task. The most accepted definition of sustainable development according to the Brundtland's 
                        report is, “To meet the needs of present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. It advocated the 
                        idea of “sustainable growth”.(1) According to The World Conservation Strategy report (1980), by the International Union for the Conservation 
                        of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), for development to be sustainable it must take into account the social and economic factors as well 
                        as the ecological ones.

                        India is presently emerging as an economic superpower, but in contrast, there is another profile of India. We constitute around 17% of the world's population, but account for about 35% of the poor and 40% of the illiterates in the world.(2) Experiences from the economic reform indicate that while there have been improvements in economic growth, foreign exchange, IT revolution, export growth, and so on, inequality in income distribution has been growing simultaneously (ratio of urban to rural income is 4.5).(2) Exclusion from benefits of economic revolution has been continued in terms of low agricultural growth (agriculture's share in GDP has been reduced to half, with no decrease in dependent population in the agricultural sector(2)), low quality employment growth, concentration of poverty in certain groups (SC / ST), occupation (agricultural and casual labor), and region; and inadequate development of women and children. Our sex ratio continues to remain favorable to men. Studies based on hospital statistics in South Delhi indicate that sex-ratio at birth is as low as 500 females per 1000 males,(3) All the above factors have resulted in the widening of economic and social disparity, which is a threat to sustainable development. The present economic growth helps to create more opportunities for the more educated section of the upper and middle class, with a ‘trickle-down’ effect on a section of the poor.

                        To meet the challenging situation of widening economic and social disparity, inclusive growth is the best tool, but it is a dream without improvement in agricultural growth, employment generation, poverty reduction, and involvement of the social sector (health, education, and women empowerment). We must learn from China in this regard. Elements of the successful experience of the Chinese such as, high and labor-releasing agricultural growth, favorable income distribution through broad-based agricultural growth, availability of infrastructure, higher levels of literacy and skills, inducements for the location of enterprises in rural areas, and easy access to credit and inputs for the poor section of society, are extremely relevant for developing countries. Women empowerment through replacing the “Life-Cycle Approach” of the girl child, which has a prime objective of marriage and motherhood by a “Capability Approach” – as propagated by Amartya Sen, where the girl child's contributions both in economic and social terms are given due recognition. All Acts and Schemes related to the girl child, therefore, need to be thoroughly reviewed to raise the status of the girl child as an asset rather than burden, for example, conditional cash and non-cash transfer scheme, and so on.
